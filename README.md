# JSON Ref

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nmerouze/json-ref.png)](https://travis-ci.org/nmerouze/json-ref)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/nmerouze/json-ref.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/nmerouze/json-ref)

Partial implementation of [JSON Ref](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-00) draft. The URI can only contain a fragment pointing to a value inside the document at this moment.

## Install

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'json-ref'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install json-ref

## Usage

```ruby
origin_doc = { 'title' => 'foobar', 'ref_title' => { '$ref' => '#/title' } }
JSONRef.new(origin_doc).expand
# =>
{ 'title' => 'foobar', 'ref_title' => 'foobar' }
```

It's also possible to resolve the `$ref` manually. You can specify a block and
return with *replace* value from the block.

```yaml
# other.yaml
author: "John Smith"
```

```ruby
origin_doc = { "title" => "foobar", "meta" => { "$ref" => "other.yaml" } }
JSONRef.new(origin_doc).expand do |path, ref|
  # path => "meta"
  # ref => "other.yml"
  YAML.load(File.read(ref))
end
# => { "title" => "foobar", "meta" => { "author" => "John Smith" } }
```
